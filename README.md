# Digital mapping Néstor Perlongher's "O Negócio do Michê"

## Introduction
"The research ""Negócio do michê"" (<i>Negocio del deseo</i> in Spanish) is the result of Néstor Perlongher’s masters dissertation in Anthropology at the Federal University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. As Brad Epps (ref) underscores, Perlongher’s research is emblematic for offering a groundbreaking approach to think of gender and sexuality. His ethnography in the 1980’s offered new horizons not only to Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality but also to the field later known as Queer Studies. Perlongher's avant-garde approach was remarkable for interviewing gender and sexual dissident sex workers and clients in-locus, visiting the gay ghettos in São Paulo and including his own positionality as a queer man in that urban territory.

The edited version of Perlongher’s master dissertation was originally transformed into a book in Portuguese and later on translated to Spanish. The commercial book editions of his ethnography were reduced in size, omitting details of his original ethnographic trajectory. The details explored in this project are in the vast majority based on the content exclusively found in Perlongher’s original masters dissertation.

Considering the editorial decision to not include the specific places that informed Perlongher's ethnography, this project addresses such a knowledge gap with the use of digital mapping techniques. Firstly, by providing the reader with a more immersive approach to Perlongher’s research, enriching the reading of both commercial and original versions of the text; secondly, by utilizing digital mapping techniques not available at the time the research was originally conducted, providing the reader with an interactive experience for visualizing the relationships existent within the urban space.

The order in which the places are shown in this Digital Map reflect the order in which Perlongher presents them to the reader in his original work. Likewise, the form of the names are included as stated by Perlongher in his original work (i.e. Donkin Donuts instead of Dunkin Donuts, São Luiz instead of São Luis, etc).

## About this project
This project was developed by [Euge Stumm](http://eugestumm.github.io) under the supervision of Professor [Susanna Allés-Torrent](http://susannalles.com/), at the University of Miami. The project was funded by the Digital Humanities Fellowship offered by the University of Miami.

This project relied on free, open-source technologies for developing StoryMaps. We utilized the Leaflet StoryMaps integration developed by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou. You can check more of their work, and Leaflet StoryMaps in particular, through the book [Hands-On Data Visualization](https://handsondataviz.org/).

The dataset utilized for this mapping project can be downloaded through [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pK3Z0PkVD8dIouyVeOoy6VFOmH6GHW-4ooEQS68SOds/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
